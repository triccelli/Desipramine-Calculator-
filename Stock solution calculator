#For preparing _____ mL of desipramine solution at _____ mg/mL concentration. 

vol_stock = float(input("What volume(mL) of desipramine would you like to make?"))
concentration_stock = float(input("What concentration(mg/mL) of despiramine would you like to make?"))

#MW of desipramine HCL: 302.84. MW of HCL: 36.46. MW of free base = 266.38 
#correction factor = 302.84/266.38 = 1.137 
correction = 1.137
